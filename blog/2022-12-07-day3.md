# Day 2 of Intro to Programming

## In Visual Studio
- Ctrl + D => Copy selected line below
- Ctrl + . => Fixes everything (Just kidding, but not really)


## Definitions
- State: Value of all data in a module
- Ternary Operator: Shorthand way to wite an if else statement '''(condition ? statement 1 : statement 2)'''
- JFHCI: Just Hard Code It (not Jacksonville, Fl Hardcore Initiative)
- Inheritance: Allows class to be created from existing class
- Feedback Loop: 
    - Inner Loop: Everything that happens while you write code
    - Outer Loop: Everrything that happens after we push
-Enum: Enumeration type, value type defined by a set of named constants (unchangeable/read-only variables)
- Invariance: The type to be assigned and the type assigned must be the same. This means that there is no switch between a Child (More Derived) type and a Parent (Less Derived) type.

## Tips and Tricks
- Avoid if statements when possible
- Write code in a way that after ir ships you don't have to modify it
- Download Moq for Visual Studio
- Make invalid statements impossible
- Do morning algorithms to stretch your brain
