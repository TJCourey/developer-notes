# Day 5 of Intro to Programming

## C# Syntax
- Objects
    - Building blocks of C#
    - Objects defined by entities, valus, and services
        - Entities are in some way specific
        - Values: objects are compared to other objects based on values
        - Services are something that provide funtionality to an object
    - All functions must be assigned to objects
    - Strings are immutable
    - Init keyword: only able to set on initialization
    - Required keyword: when added to constructor makes it required to initialize
- IEnumerable
    - Interface defining a single method that enumerates item
    - Still need to look further into this
- Continue keyword
    - used to skip execution step when used in a loop    
- Select keyword
    - works similar to a .map in javaScript
- .where
    - takes integer and returns a boolean
- .parse
    - takes a string and returns an integer
- Delegate
    - Unique object in .net
    - represents refrences to method with a particular parameter list and returns a type
    - Works as a kind of go between
- Extension method
    - isn't a real method but works like one
    - All of the class has to be static
    - Have to add "this" keyword to method
    - must be in same namespace
- List is an array that takes a single datatype
## C# Practices
- Defensive Coding
    - Old thought: define and validate everything
    - New thought: Don't validate unless necessary
- When experincing an error write two tests
    - First proves the problem 
    - Second to prove the fix
- .Net 6 Added implicit using
- Single letter variables usually used in anonomous function
- Strings are Immutable in .Net
