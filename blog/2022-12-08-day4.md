# Day 4 of intro to programming


## CUPID
    - Composible
        - prefer composition over inheritance
        - Emphasize encapsulation: What is more important than how
    - Unix Philosophy
        - Small focused bits of Functionality
    - Predictable 
        - Follows the principal of Least suprise
    - Idiomatic 
        - Feels Natural: use language and idioms of that language
    - Domain based
        - Be wary of spending time solving issues beyond the requirements
## SOLID
    - SRP: Single responsibilty principal
        - Code should have a single axis of change
    - Open/Close
        - Code should be open to extension and closed to modification
    - Liskov Substitution Principal
        - Prefer composition over inheritance
    - Interface Segregation Principal
        - depend on small client specific interfaces
    - Dependency Inversion Principal
        - Rely on what not how
        - Depend on abstractions not concretions
## Test Principals
    - Feedback Loops
        - Static loops
            - Fastest feedback
            - Linterss
            - Compilers
            - won't let you run code with errors
        - Unit Tests
            - Designed to be a little slower than compiler
            - Short is sweet, should run quickly to be most effective
        - Integration test
            - test external systems reaction
            - DataBase, FileSystems, etc
            - Automate users
            - Slower and run leess frequently
        - End to End testing
            - "Real" tests
            - nothing is faked aside from user

## Test Doubles
    - Why use them
        - Need to test against systems, services, and libraries that don't exist yet
        - Simulate events in production environment
    - Types of Doubles
        - Dummies: not really for testing, used when testing something something outside of code
        - Stubs: for state based testing(when you query for a dependancy), dependancy is a state change 
        - Mocks: for interaction testing "tell don't ask" the response
        - Fakes: replace and simullate real but expensive things(i.e. databases)
